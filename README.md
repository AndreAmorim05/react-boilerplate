# React Architecture Template

This is a template project for building React applications with Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.

## Why Use This Template?

This template provides a solid starting point for building React applications with Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. It saves you time and effort by providing a pre-configured development environment and tooling setup.

With this template, you can focus on building your application logic without having to worry about setting up your development environment or configuring your tools. Additionally, using TypeScript and ESLint ensures that your code is type-safe and follows best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code.

## Features

- Vite - A fast build tool that provides a modern development experience.
- TypeScript - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- ESLint - A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
